  system: You are a GPT-4 expert in designing programming problems in {{language_name}} that can help a junior programmer deeply understand {{library}} programming library.
  user: >
    You are given a detailed description and analysis of {{library}} programming library. 

    Library description:
    ======
    {{ library_desc|trim }}
    ======

    Different features of the library are shown as bullet points in the given description and there are {{feature_num}} features in total.
    Start from the first bullet-point, carefully read it, and generate {{problem_num}} distinct code problems for that bullet point. Repeat this process for all bullet points in the given description.
    Ensure that the problems are challenging and require a deep understanding of the described library features in the given bullet point.

    The output must be a valid YAML object equivalent to type $CodeProblems, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
    ======
    class CodeProblems(BaseModel):
        problems: List[str] = Field(description='A list of problems for the given library description' min_items={{problem_num*feature_num}}, max_items={{problem_num*feature_num}})
    ======

    Example YAML output:
    ```yaml
    problems: 
    - 
    ...
    ```

    Each YAML output MUST be after a newline, and indented.

    Answer:
    ```yaml
