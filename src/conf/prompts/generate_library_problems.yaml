  temperature: 0.8
  system: You are a GPT-4 expert in designing programming problems in {{language_name}} that can help a junior programmer deeply understand {{library}} programming library.
  user: >
    You are given a detailed description and analysis of {{library}} programming library. 

    Library description:
    ======
    {{ library_desc|trim }}
    ======

    Different features of the library are shown as bullet points in the given description and there are around {{feature_num}} bullet points in total.
    Start from the first bullet-point, carefully read it, and generate {{problem_num}} distinct code problems for that bullet point. Repeat this process for all bullet points in the given description.
    Ensure that the problems vary in difficulty and properly evaluate the understanding of the each given library feature.
    The description of the problem should be concise, limited to one paragraph, and described in plain text without any markdown notations.
    If any files or outside resources are required for the problem to be solved, a requirement of the problem should be building a dummy version of the file with the given content to make sure that the problem can be properly solved.

    The output must be a valid YAML object equivalent to type $CodeProblems, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
    ======
    class CodeProblems(BaseModel):
        problems: List[str] = Field(description='A list of problems in string format, each considering a bullet point in the given library description' min_items={{problem_num*feature_num}}, max_items={{problem_num*feature_num}})
    ======

    Example YAML output:
    ```yaml
    problems: 
    - |
      Write a function that makes a file called 'example.txt' with the content 'Hello, World!', and then uses the library to process the file and return the number of characters in the file.
    - |
      Write a function that uses this capability of the library by getting a list of integers and returning the product of all the elements in the list.
    ...
    ```

    Each YAML output MUST be after a newline, indented, with block scalar indicator ('|').

    Answer:
    ```yaml
